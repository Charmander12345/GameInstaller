Some major changes to the map and the landscape material have been made:
- Landscape size was increased by about 30%
- Landscape material was completely redone with new textures and foliage.
- Landscape weather effects are added so that the landscape reacts dynamically to weather changes
- Implemented world partition to compensate for the bigger size and increase performance significantly.
Some more changes regarding the map:
- (Modeling and sculpting of the landscape (mountains, hills, uneven open areas) has been almost completed.)
- (Some villages have been made and some roads have been added.)
- Bigger cities are not yet included.

Changes to assets:
- Nanite added to almost every mesh to improve performance.
