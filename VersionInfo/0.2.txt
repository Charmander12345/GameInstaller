This version mainly focuses on graphical improvements. Tho it is not perfect just jet it is greatly improved. 
Things to test out in this version:
- Walk up to the blacksmith and see if you get an interaction notice
Known Issues:
- Loading screen might disappear to early which leads to the player being able to see foliage spawn in
- Scarecrows physics are messed up when game is paused
- Big parts of the map are not textured (black)
- Initial spawn location is pretty far away from the village
